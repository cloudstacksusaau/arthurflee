	<p>
	Broken bones require specialized knowledge and care for proper healing. Dr. Arthur Lee is a highly trained orthopedic physician who specializes in the treatment of fractures of the hand, wrist, foot and ankle. 

	If broken bones in these areas do not receive the correct care, it can have a lifelong effect on mobility and range of motion. With the use of onsite digital x-rays at his office in Cincinnati, Ohio, Dr. Lee provides expert diagnosis and treatment for many different kinds of fractures involving the elbow, shoulder, tibia, knee, femur, pelvis and spine.

	Bones are the hardest tissues in your body, but they can split or break under too much pressure or force. Fractures can occur in a variety of ways. The most common causes of fractures are traumatic injuries, prolonged stress from overuse, and bone-weakening diseases, such as osteoporosis or tumors.

	There are many types of fractures. They can range from a hairline crack to a bone that has broken into several pieces. Some simple fractures can be treated right in our office, while more complex breaks may require surgery. Non-operative treatments for fractures may include braces, orthotics or casts.
